# Phase_3 Project Prediction

## Overview

Churn is a measure of how many customers stop using a product or service due to some certain reasons making them not to use them. It is calculated by dividing the number of customers who have stopped using the product or service by the total number of customers who have ever used the product or service. The churn rate is usually expressed as a percentage. A high churn rate can indicate that there is a problem with the product or service. It can also be a sign that the company is not doing a good job of retaining customers.

In this project, we will try to determine the churn rate for future customers and find a way of minimizing it.
